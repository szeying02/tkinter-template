# tkinter Template
This repository provides a basic template for the popular Python GUI library -- tkinter. After working on a university coding project (BT2102) using tkinter, I decided to compile and create a basic tkinter template for future references. 

## Python Libraries Used
`tkinter`, `tkmacosx`, `PIL`

Due to the inherent limitation of button colours of tkinter for Mac users, `tkmacosx` was used to have the flexibility of button colours. This may cause problems for non-mac users. Modifications to parts of the code where `tkmacosx` was used should be sufficient to fix it. 

## Usage 
1. Download python / python3 and all the libraries used on terminal. 
2. Run the program by typing `python main.py` or `python3 main.py` in the terminal. 

## Features
1. Moving on to a different page while using the same window (frames)
2. Using input text boxes (entry)
3. Pop-up windows / message boxes
4. Generating tables using tkinter Treeview
5. External images as backgrounds
